# DataScienceExamples
Examples of various data science &amp; data analysis topics using various sources of data.

Most of this repository will likely be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. I hope to include links to the data for all of the notebooks so that the notebooks can be used by others.

Some of the tools that I'm using so far in this repository:
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Scipy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Matplotlib

I also hope to add in examples using other tools such as:
  - Keras
  - PySpark
  - XGBoost
  - Seaborn

Current notebooks:

Basics:

  - Analyzing the UCI ML breast cancer data. Some topics covered: Logistic regression, PCA, RFE, L1 regularization, learning curves, validation curves, imbalanced data, train/test splitting, pipelines, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves.

NYC Tree Census Data:

  - Looking at how species of trees are spread throughout the city. Some topics covered: Linear regression, visualization, joining different data sets, feature engineering
  - Looking at the distributions of trees in different neighborhoods. Some topics covered: Linear regression, nonlinear regression, k-fold cross validation, error estimation, minimization/optimization.
